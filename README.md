# Underwater Image Enhancement

This project was created by Jonathan Nguyen and Bruno Bombassaro for UCLA's ECE 113D Design Capstone Class. The goal of this project is to implement the algorithm in [Ancuti et. al.](doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2759252) on a platform running C. Specifically we tested our implementation on the STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-H745ZI board. The project is still in its extremely early stages and the README will be updated as more details are finalized.
